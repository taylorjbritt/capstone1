#I ended up not using this function, but the idea was to test the two different null hypotheses:
#that the values for 2020 and previous years from BEFORE the quarantine date were the same, and 
# that the values AFTER that same date were the same. However, I have doubts about the statistical 
#soundness of the test, and it basically always returned a p-value below .05, so I didn't include 
#it in the markdown.
